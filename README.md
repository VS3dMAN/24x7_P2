## How to Add Images

1.  Navigate to the `images` folder in this directory.
2.  Add your image files.
3.  **Rename your images sequentially starting from 1:**
    - `1.jpg`
    - `2.jpg`
    - `3.jpg`
    - ... and so on.

The website will automatically detect and load all images in numerical order until it finds a gap in the sequence (e.g., if you have 1.jpg, 2.jpg, and 4.jpg, it will stop after 2.jpg).

## Notes
- To ensure optimal layout, use images of varying aspect ratios (portrait, landscape).
- The grid will automatically adjust based on the number of images loaded.
